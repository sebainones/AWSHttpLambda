AWS Http Lambda for learning purposes
This a very simple repo in which I'm trying to play with and learn about AWS Lamda Functions.

I have taken some ideas from[Create AWS Lambda function with .NET Core C# and create a HTTP API Gateway trigger](https://blog.ninethsense.com/technology/code/create-aws-lambda-function-with-net-core-c-and-create-a-http-api-gateway-trigger-part-2/)
